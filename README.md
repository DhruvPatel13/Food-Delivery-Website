# Food Delivery Website (MERN Stack)

This is my first full-stack project, built using the MERN stack.<br/>
It includes a fully responsive user interface where customers can register, login, and place food orders online.

The admin panel gives restaurant staff full control over the menu, orders, and special offers.

Key features:-<br/>
• User registration, login, and food ordering.<br/>
• Admin panel to add/remove food items, update order statuses, and manage special offers.<br/>
• Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
